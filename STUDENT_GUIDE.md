## üí° Tips for Success

### Using AI Tools Effectively
1. **Start with a clear goal** - Know what you want to build
2. **Iterate** - Use AI suggestions as starting points, then refine
3. **Understand the code** - Don't just copy-paste, learn what it does
4. **Debug actively** - AI tools make mistakes, you need to catch them
5. **Document usage** - Note what tools helped with what tasks

### Writing Good Documentation
- Explain **what** your project does and **why**
- Include **how** to run it step-by-step
- Describe **challenges** and how you overcame them
- Reflect on **what you learned**

### Getting Help
1. **Check the course website first** - Answers may already be there
2. **Search online** - Stack Overflow, documentation, tutorials
3. **Use AI assistants** - ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor can help debug
4. **Ask classmates** - Discuss concepts (but don't share code)
5. **Office hours** - Email instructor to schedule time
6. **Open an issue** - Use GitHub issues for technical questions

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Waiting until the last minute** - Start early!
2. ‚ùå **Not testing your code** - Always test before submitting
3. ‚ùå **Poor documentation** - A great project needs great docs
4. ‚ùå **Forgetting dependencies** - Include requirements.txt or package.json
5. ‚ùå **Not using version control properly** - Commit often with clear messages
6. ‚ùå **Ignoring the template** - Use the provided structure
7. ‚ùå **Not documenting AI usage** - This is required!
